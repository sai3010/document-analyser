# document-analyser
First attempt to build a text classifer for pdf documents using textblob

## How to use this
- clone the repository
- take any sample pdf file 
- ```pip3 install textblob PyPDF2```
- run the code using the following command ```python3 app.py -f sample.pdf```

#### Each sentence in the pdf is analysed as positive or negative

# Note
The accuracy will definitely be poor due to lack of dataset, please feel free to create a pull request to add more data or make changes :)
